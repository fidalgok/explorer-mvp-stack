**Feature: Firebase Authentication Integration**

**1. User Story:**

*   **As a** user,
*   **I want to** be able to securely create an account and log into the application,
*   **So that** I can access my personalized data and features.

**2. Detailed User Stories:**

*   **Authentication (Google):**
    *   **As a** user,
    *   **I want to** be able to sign in with my Google account,
    *   **So that** I can quickly access the application with my existing Google account.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   **As a** user,
    *   **I want to** see clear error messages if my login or signup attempts fail,
    *   **So that** I know what went wrong and can fix the problem.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   **As a** user,
    *   **I want to** remain logged in when I close and reopen the application,
    *  **So that** I don't need to log in every time.
*    **Protected Routes**
    *   **As a** user,
    *    **I want to** be redirected to the login page if I attempt to access a protected route without being logged in,
    *    **So that** I can only access the routes I should have access to.

**3. Feature Implementation Overview:**

This section outlines the key steps required to implement Firebase Authentication, and what files you should be looking to change.

*   **Firebase Setup:**
    *   **Firebase Project Creation:**
        *   Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console.](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
            - Create a name for your project and follow the prompts.
        *   Enable the "Email/Password" (optional) and "Google" sign-in (required) methods in the Firebase Authentication settings.
        *   Get the Firebase Admin SDK configuration details (API key, auth domain, etc.).
        *   The admin setup can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).
    *   **Environment Variables:**
        *   Store Firebase config details in environment variables.
        *   Create a `firebase.server.ts` to abstract the firebase configuration away from the client.
    *   **Firebase Client SDK Integration:**
        *   Install the Firebase client SDK: `npm install firebase`.
        *  Initialize Firebase in your application at the top level of the app

*   **Authentication UI:**
    *   **Login Page:**
        *   Create a `/login` route.
        *   Include form for email/password login
        *   Add Google sign-in button.
        *   Display error messages if authentication fails.
    *   **Signup Page:**
        *   Create a `/signup` route.
        *   Include form for new user registration with email/password.
        *   Display error messages if registration fails.
    *   **Logout:**
        *   Implement the logout functionality on the relevant parts of the application. This can use a `Form` and an action to mutate the data.

*   **Firebase Authentication Logic:**
    *   **Authentication Helpers:** Create a `~/utils/auth.server.ts` to abstract all firebase logic away from the component.
        *   Implement functions for user registration, login with email/password, Google sign-in, and logout.
        *   Use Firebase Auth SDK to handle authentication requests.
    *   **Error Handling:**
        *   Handle errors from Firebase (e.g., invalid email, weak password, user not found).
        *   Provide informative error messages to the user.
        *   Use React Router error handling and error boundaries to catch the errors from Firebase in your loader and action methods.

*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Session Storage:**
        *   Create a `~/utils/sessions.server.ts` to handle the session storage.
        *   Implement functionality for getting, setting and destroying session data using react router utilities.
    *   **Session Logic:**
        *   After successful Firebase authentication, store the user ID in the session cookie.
        *   In `loader` methods, check for a valid user session, and redirect to `/login` if not authenticated.
        *   Create action to handle the login functionality, and store the userId in the session.
         *   Create action to handle the logout functionality, and remove the userId from the session.

*  **Protected Routes:**
    *   **Loader Check:** In your `loader` methods for protected routes, check if a valid user session exists (i.e. the `userId` exists in the session) if not redirect to `/login`.
    *    **Error Boundary:** Ensure there is an error boundary at each route to handle any errors that might occur.

*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   After a user logs in with Firebase, get their user profile information and save it to your database.

**4. Technical Considerations:**

*   **Firebase Client SDK:**
    *   Use the official Firebase SDK for React.
    *   Handle Firebase errors gracefully.
*   **React Router Integration:**
    *   Use React Router `loaders` for fetching data and checking authentication status.
    *   Use React Router `actions` for user login, registration and logout.
    *   Use React Router error boundaries for any errors that occur.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   Securely manage session cookies.
    *   Handle session expiration and user logout appropriately.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Provide clear error messages.
    *   Use React Router error boundaries.
*   **Security:**
    *   Sanitize user input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Use Firebase's authentication features to prevent unauthorized access.
    *  Use `httpOnly` and `secure` cookies for best security practices.
*  **User Experience:**
     * Provide loading states and pending UIs when data is fetching, and performing mutations.
     * Provide immediate feedback to the user.

**5. Out of Scope:**

*   Password reset/recovery functionality.
*   Social login providers (other than Google).
*   Multi-factor authentication.
*   Advanced user management features (e.g., role-based access control).

**6. Success Metrics:**

*   Users can successfully create an account and log into the application with email/password.
*   Users can successfully log in with their Google account.
*   Users can successfully log out of the application.
*   Users are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access a protected route without being logged in.
*   The app displays informative error messages for any authentication failures.

**7. Next Steps:**

*   Detailed UI design for authentication pages.
*   Implementation of Firebase authentication logic in `~/utils/auth.server.ts`
*   Implementation of session management in `~/utils/sessions.server.ts`
*   Integration with protected routes
*   Creation of unit tests.
