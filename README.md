## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication:
   - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable "Google" provider
   - Add authorized domains for your application

3. Set up Firestore:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database (start in development mode)
   - Set up your security rules

4. Get your Firebase configuration:
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll to "Your apps" and create a web app
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object

5. Set up required environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-client-email
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
   ```

   Get these values from:
   - Project Settings > Service accounts > Generate new private key
   - Generate a secure random string for SESSION_SECRET

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
